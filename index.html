<p class="main-idea">The entangled history and lingering effects of settler colonialism and slavery in the Americas is an intertwined story shared by Africans and indigenous peoples of the Americas.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>Maroon societies, which have existed throughout the Americas, from the Quilombo in Brazil, to the Seminoles in the Southern U.S., to Nanny Town in Jamaica, were established by Africans who had fearlessly escaped the horrors of European enslavement by creating isolated settlements in the wilderness along side indigenous peoples who, too, were relentlessly resisting the colonialist model. Today, mass incarceration, gentrification, globalization, deforestation, forced migration and land theft etc., are contemporary forms of settler colonialism and slavery. African and indigenous people continue to struggle for the sovereignty and self-determination that maroon societies previously activated.</p>

<p>The concept of “Marronage” – which essentially means escaping bondage – is one that encompasses the physical, emotional, spiritual, cultural and psychological aspects of human freedoms – each of which came under attack by colonization. In both African and indigenous communities, the process of individual and collective decolonization is seen as necessitating a return to one’s cultural roots in order to heal these wounds and exercise full human freedom. This is exemplified in the concepts of <em>Sankofa</em> in Ghana and <em>Biiskabiyang</em> in indigenous Canada.</p>

<p>“<strong>Marronage: Flights to Freedom</strong>” is a visual exploration of past, present and future resurgences within the current context of neo-colonialism. This aptly titled exhibition is a multidisciplinary presentation of contemporary artwork by select members of the <strong>Guerrillas in the Midst</strong> artist collective. In an ever continuing struggle to hold on to our creative initiative, we engage in a process of returning to ourselves, by reengaging with the things that we left behind or that were taken away (e.g., languages, spiritual practices, cosmologies, and philosophies). Through this multilayered visual conversation, we reemerge.</p>

<p>The choice of visual language and the aesthetic practices involved are central to the artists’ definition of themselves in relation to the universe and their social environment. The <strong>Guerrillas in the Midst</strong> artist collective is, in fact, a maroon society itself. Emboldened by the power of community and bonded by the pursuit of equal access and representation in artistic spaces, <strong>Guerrillas in the Midst</strong> aims to dismantle the elitist constructs erected by the art establishment. By engaging with members of diverse communities, convening artists shunned by conventional institutions, and occupying makeshift spaces, <strong>Guerrillas in the Midst</strong> makes room for artistic “_outsiders_” to be seen. Through art exhibitions, community outreach and art education, <strong>Guerrillas in the Midst</strong> endeavors to preserve the cultural heritage of artistic expression in Brooklyn and beyond.</p>
